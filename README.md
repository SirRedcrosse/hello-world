# hello-world

I'm Vrixton Phillips, a recent graduate of Nicholls State University, trying to learn Git and GitHub in order to make my own GitPage Blog with Jekyll!

I am learning this, Markup, Pandoc, Zotero, Linux Command Line, &c. are all on my list and I'm only an English Literature and Rhetoric/Writing major.

My, how the times have changed.
